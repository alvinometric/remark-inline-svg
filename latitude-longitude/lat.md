I like coding maps, but I would always forget how to remember latitude and longitude. I would always mix them up. I tried some mnemonic techniques (like, latitudes = ladder) but none of them ever worked.

Here are a couple of tips to remember latitude and longitude.

## 1. X/Y coordinates

Tip #1: The simplest, but not the easiest, is to memorise this:

**Latitude is y and longitude is x.**

![On a map latitude is the y axis and longitude is the x axis.](./map-x-y.inline.svg)

Thatâ€™s it, Latitude is the y axis and longitude is the x axis.

I tried that but would still mix them up at times. So I came up with the next tip.
